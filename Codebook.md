STUDY DESIGN
==========================

The data set was processed by joining the test and train sets, labeling the variables according to the features.txt and then filtering them down to the variables we chose to make this report. We chose this number of variables because it made the output result easier to understand and to interpret. The other tables can easily be created by uncommenting parts of the code that pertain to each table, but the one that was uploaded is the one being analysed here.


CODE BOOK
==========================

Activity      1      AN     Activity performed.
Activity .Activity Code
	01 = WALKING
	02 = WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	03 = WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	04 = SITTING
	05 = STANDING
	06 = LAYING

SubjectId       2      AN     Unique ID of the subject who performed the activity.    

AccelerometerMeanX         3      AN    Mean value for X variable in Body measurement measured by the accelerometer.

AccelerometerMeanY         4      AN    Mean value for Y variable in Body measurement measured by the accelerometer.

AccelerometerMeanZ         5      AN    Mean value for Z variable in Body measurement measured by the accelerometer.

AccelerometerSDX         6      AN    Standard Error value for X variable in Body measurement measured by the accelerometer.

AccelerometerSDY         7      AN    Standard Error value for Y variable in Body measurement measured by the accelerometer.

AccelerometerSDZ         8      AN    Standard Error value for Z variable in Body measurement measured by the accelerometer.
